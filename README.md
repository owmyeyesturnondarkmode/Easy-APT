Built in GNU NANO, it is a very simple, lightweight TLI to help install programs for any operating system that uses the APT package manager. It uses the BASH command select, which I find VERY useful as a programmer; because unlike windows batch where you have to code your own menus, this just generates it for you. And I don't like repeating myself, but it is VERY useful.
