Built in GNU NANO, it is a very simple, lightweight command-line tool to help install programs for any operating system that uses the APT package manager. It uses the BASH command select, which I find VERY useful as an amatuer programmer; beause unlike windows batch where you have to code your own menus, this just generates it for you. And I don't like repeating myself, but it is VERY useful.

The installer directly downloads Easy-APT to your computer.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**
You may have to run `$ chmod +x <Easyaptinstaller.sh OR Easyapt.sh>` if you encounter the `Permission denied` error. If that still dosen't work, try running it with `$ ./<Easyapt.sh OR Easyaptinstaller.sh>` if you aren't already.
